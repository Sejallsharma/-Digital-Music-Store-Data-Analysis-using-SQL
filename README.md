# -Digital-Music-Store-Data-Analysis-using-SQL

In this project, I analyzed a music store's data using SQL to derive insights and optimize strategies. Tasks included basic queries to find top invoices and high-spending customers, intermediate queries on track lengths and rock genre preferences, and advanced queries on customer spending by artist and popular genres across countries. The goal was to use SQL for actionable insights to improve operational decisions and customer engagement.
